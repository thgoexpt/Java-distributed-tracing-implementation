/**
 * This is the base class for http-based integration tests. It has a few features to ensure tests
 * cover common instrumentation bugs. Most of this optimizes for instrumentation occurring on a
 * different thread than main (which does the assertions).
 *
 * <p><pre><ul>
 *   <li>{@link StrictScopeDecorator} double-checks threads don't leak contexts</li>
 *   <li>Span reporting double-checks the span was de-scoped on finish, to prevent leaks</li>
 *   <li>Spans report into a concurrent blocking queue to prevent assertions race conditions</li>
 *   <li>After tests complete, the queue is strictly checked to catch redundant span reporting</li>
 * </ul></pre>
 *
 * <p>As a blocking queue is used, {@link #takeSpan take a span} to perform assertions on it.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Span span = takeSpan();
 * assertThat(span.traceId()).isEqualTo(traceId);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <em>All spans reported must be taken before the test completes!</em>
 *
 * <h3>Debugging test failures</h3>
 *
 * <p>If a test hangs, likely {@link BlockingQueue#take()} is being called when a span wasn't
 * reported. An exception or bug could cause this (for example, the error handling route not
 * calling {@link brave.Span#finish()}).
 *
 * <p>If a test fails on {@link After}, it can mean that your test created a span, but didn't {@link BlockingQueue#take()}
 * it off the queue. If you are testing something that creates a span, you may not want to verify
 * each one. In this case, at least take them similar to below:
 *
 * <p><pre>{@code
 * for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) takeSpan(); // we expected 10 spans
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>This code looks hard.. why are we using a concurrent queue? My http client is easy</h3>
 *
 * <p>Some http client instrumentation are fully synchronous (everything on the main thread).
 * Testing such instrumentation could be easier, ex reporting into a list. Some other race-detecting
 * features may feel overkill in this case.
 *
 * <p>Consider though, this is a base class for all http instrumentation: servers (always report off
 * main thread) and asynchronous clients (often report off main). Also, even blocking clients can
 * execute their "on headers received" hook on a separate thread! Even if the http client you are
 * working on does everything on the same thread, a small change could invalidate that assumption.
 * If something written to work on one thread is suddenly working on two threads, tests can fail
 * "randomly", perhaps not until an unrelated change to JRE. When tests fail, they also make it
 * impossible to release new code until we disable the test or fix it. Bugs or race conditions
 * instrumentation can be very time consuming to solve. For example, they can appear as "flakes" in
 * CI servers such as Travis, which can be near impossible to debug.
 *
 * <p>Bottom-line is that we accept that strict tests are harder up front, and not necessary for a
 * few types of blocking client instrumentation. However, the majority of http instrumentation have
 * to concern themselves with multi-threaded behavior and if we always do, the chances of builds
 * breaking are less.
